Band.create(username: 'Band1UserName', password: 'band1pw', band_name: 'Nalani & Sarina', bio: 'Getting music fans to agree on anything is next to impossible. That’s why the quick rise to national recognition of identical twin sisters Nalani & Sarina is such an astounding story. These two audacious young artists, from west-central New Jersey, have developed a distinctive blend of traditionalist soul-rock and modern pop likely to keep their faces in the spotlight for years to come. Legendary music critic/Sirius radio host Dave Marsh called their EP, Scattered World, “some of the best music being made”, and fans, critics and taste-makers have echoed his praise. Nalani & Sarina have all the elements in place for success and stardom. Their captivating look is on display in the video for “Get Away”, a propulsive cut from Scattered World, that was in regular rotation on mtvU and other video outlets. Their smart, kinetic live show, whether as a duo or with their band, has made the sisters favorites on the Northeastern club scene.', genre: "Soul-Rock / Modern Pop", band_members: "Nalani Bolton, Sarina Bolton", img_url: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmcVbtjXcAQI_uf.jpg:large')

Led by songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Alex DeSimine and joined by drummer Tom Criblez and fellow multi-instrumentalist Dylan Gleit, each member of the band uses every limb they have to create a soundscape that transcends their three-person appearance. The band’s debut LP “Plans” was released on November 9, 2018 and my oh my did it rock. The album was recorded and mixed by the trio in their Bushwick home, comprised of songs Alex had written over the past few years chronicling a cyclical relationship with toxic self-improvement.

# Question.create(band_id: 1, listener_id: 2, question_response: 'How did you guys start playing together? At what point did you decide to go pro?', has_answered: true)
# Answer.create(band_id: 1, question_id: 1, answer_response: 'Nalani — We actually started off with classical piano, and that sort of ventured off into hopping onto other instruments, because the piano actually gave us a really good foundation. For us it was easy since the piano’s laid out so it’s easier to comprehend, so from there we jumped around to the guitar and the ukulele. We actually took opera for five years and did musical theater, but it was very limited for twin parts, so it wasn’t until we were around sixteen that we decided to start writing songs. We saw a lot of people our age doing that. I remember at Battle of The Bands we saw all these kids our age writing songs, performing, and were like, “Hey, we can totally do that!” And it wasn’t until that point that we decided to try out the whole songwriting thing. So we met up with some local musicians, put together a band, and started writing and performing out in New York. This was all at sixteen, so we would always get kicked out of bars and places like that. But that was our first real jump into the music business, and that eventually led us to make the decision Senior year — we only had to take one credit — to do this full time.')

# Question.create(band_id: 1, listener_id: 1, question_response: 'Why did you play the same instruments instead of divvying up different ones?', has_answered: true)
# Answer.create(band_id: 1, question_id: 2, answer_response: 'Sarina — We never really made a distinctive decision, like, “OK, this is how it’s going to be.” We both just played the same instruments. We thought it was kind of fun to play musical chairs on stage, but when we were first learning them, it wasn’t a competitive thing it was more like if one of us picked up the guitar, the other one did too, and we started diving into it more just because we were curious.')

# Answer.create(band_id: 1, question_id: 3, answer_response: 'Sarina — It’s really interesting. When writing, we always get asked if we have telepathy. And I think the truest form of that is through songwriting. So every single song that we write has a part of both of us, whether it’s us both sitting in a room and deciding to write together, if one of us comes up with something the other one finishes a line, or if one of us is stuck it’s a nice way to finish a song or just go through the creative motions with somebody. A lot of people forget that it’s a co-write, it’s two people, a lot of people just bunch us into one, but I think being twins especially, it’s almost — and not in a creepy way — we can almost read each other’s minds. We can straight up tell each other, “No, that sucks. Don’t write that.” Or, “Change this line.” And fully trust each other and not feel like someone’s walking all over it.')

# Question.create(band_id: 1, listener_id: 1, question_response: 'What are some of the challenges you face as up-and-coming musicians?', has_answered: true)
# Answer.create(band_id: 1, question_id: 4, answer_response: 'Nalani — I think being both young and female definitely takes a toll in trying to make a name for yourself. People are so quick to judge once they know your age or once they know your sex. I feel like some people are vultures, especially in the business. That kind of ties back to the name of our single that just came out, ‘Young and Inexperienced’. We always get questions on how that relates to us, because the song is about young kids trying to find a job and being taken seriously as people. The way that we relate to it is that even though we didn’t go to college and didn’t have student loans to pay off, we’re still trying to make a name for ourselves and being taken seriously, which a lot of our friends are going through themselves. So that’s how we really channel that emotion, because we have felt it in trying to make it in this business. People are quick to judge. They don’t take you seriously when you say, “Yeah, we have our own business, we’re the CEO’s of our own business, we launched our own record label.” It takes a lot and people are so quick to assume that you’re not capable of doing that at a young age. But I think it all comes with confidence and if you have a vision for yourself.')

# Question.create(band_id: 1, listener_id: 2, question_response: 'How does your music now differ from your previous EP’s?', has_answered: true)
# Answer.create(band_id: 1, question_id: 4, answer_response: 'Nalani — With each album we like to think that we’re evolving and trying to challenge ourselves in a different way. With this one in particular we realized that a lot of these songs relate to millennials, and that’s not exactly the right word, because the word ‘millennials’ gets such a bad rap. But it’s really about people our age. And we didn’t realize that until we actually compiled the songs. When we go in and write, we kind of just write about whatever inspires us, and then afterwards we try and see if there’s a common theme or if there’s something we can pull from it. But with this album in particular, we not only try and take on other people’s stories, but we take on other forms, or we try and push the boundaries a little bit with concepts and topics that are more topical instead of just relationships. Looking back our first album, ‘Lessons Learned, was pretty relationship-based.')
